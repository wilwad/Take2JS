This is a card game we used to play back in the day. Multiple players. Each player is given an initial amount of cards.
A random card is placed face up on the table and each player takes a turn putting a card from their cards.
If the player has no matching card (number, type), they have to pick from the deck.
The following cards are special when played:
2 : the next player has to pick up two cards and skip a turn
7 : player plays again
Jack : reverse order of play
8 : changes to the card on the table to match this card

When a player has 2 cards left, they shout "2 cards!".
When a player only has 1 card left, they must shout "Ticket!". If they do not they are punished by picking up one card from the deck.
